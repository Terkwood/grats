# Grats 🌞

Make a gratitude list and keep it private on your device 🔏

## privacy pitch

The app is designed for your privacy. You need to browse to a location on the web to start running the app. Once the app is downloaded, anything you do to interact with the app stays on your device, and isn't sent back to the internet in any way. The author of this app won't know how grateful you are for things, and the app won't share the info to advertisers, servers, or data aggregators online.

All data is stored in [browser localstorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).

You are encouraged to browse the source and verify the program's functionality.

The gratitude list is written to your device in an _unencypted_ format. Always run anti-virus scans and follow recommendations for basic internet safety!
